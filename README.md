## 🐚What is ZDE (Zippyshare Downloadable Extractor) UI version?

ZLE🐚 is short for Zippyshare Downloadable Extractor, this tool is a utility for extracting downloadable link from the shared zippyshare link.
This work best when you have many shared part link of zippyshare.


## 🐚Why is Zippyshare Downloadable Extractor?

Some share game, software or document online will share using zippyshare. Which sometime contain morethen 20 parts.
If we go to the link one by one and click download manually it will not fit for lazy people like me.
Instead ZLE will make it easy:
  - Spend less time
  - Get downloadable link
  - Link can be pass to downloader tool
  - Don't miss any parts or confuse the link is already download or not
